git clone --recursive https://github.com/mhep-transition/mhep-django
```

Or, if you've already cloned `mhep-django`, run:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

## Start Django

With the vagrant box running, run:

`vagrant ssh`

Once connected to the box, simply run:

`make run`

This will start the Django server.
